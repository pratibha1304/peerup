PeerUp: A Real-Time P2P Collaboration Platform
PeerUp is a full-stack web application designed to streamline project collaboration. It provides a real-time environment for peers to connect, chat, and manage their shared projects, all in one place.
This project is a work-in-progress, born from my personal idea to build a tool that solves the common frictions of remote group work.

The Vision
As a student and developer, I often found it difficult to coordinate with peers on projects. Communication was scattered across different apps, and tracking progress was a manual process. I built PeerUp to be the single source of truth for a project team‚Äîa dedicated space to foster real-time collaboration and make building together easier.
Application Preview
(This is the most important part! Add a screenshot or a 5-second GIF of your application here. It proves your project works and looks good.)
To add an image:
Take a screenshot and add it to your project folder (e.g., in an assets folder).
Push the image to GitHub.

üåü Key Features
üîê Secure User Authentication: Safe and secure login/signup functionality powered by Firebase Authentication.
ü§ù Real-Time Chat: A live chat feature (using Socket.io or Firebase Realtime Database) for seamless team communication.
üìÇ Project Workspaces: (Example feature) Users can create or join project "rooms" to keep conversations and files organized.
‚úçÔ∏è P2P Collaboration Tools: (Example feature) Features like a shared code editor, to-do list, or file sharing.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

1. Prerequisites
You must have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed on your computer.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/pratibha1304/peerup.git](https://github.com/pratibha1304/peerup.git)
cd peerup

3. Installation
This project likely has two parts: a client folder and a server folder. You will need to install dependencies for both.

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install

4. Configuration (CRITICAL)
This project requires API keys from Firebase to run. You must create your own Firebase project to get these.
For the Frontend (Client-side):
In the client/src directory, create a file named firebase.config.js.
Do not add this file to your .gitignore. Instead, create a firebase.config.js.example file to show the structure.
Add your Firebase project's configuration keys:
// src/firebase.config.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export default app;
For the Backend (Server-side):
In the server directory, create a file named .env.
Add .env to your .gitignore file if it's not already there.
Add any necessary environment variables (e.g., your Database connection string):

# .env
MONGO_DB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5001

5. Run the Application
You will need to run both the server and the client in separate terminal windows.
# In your first terminal (from the /server directory)
npm start
# Your server will be running on http://localhost:5001 (or your PORT)
# In your second terminal (from the /client directory)
npm start
# Your React app will open on http://localhost:3000

üó∫ Future Roadmap

PeerUp is an actively growing project. Here are some features I plan to implement next:
[ ] Shared document editing
[ ] Video and voice call integration
[ ] A more advanced project management dashboard
